This is a powerful framework for the development of projects by [3D Digital](http://3ddigital.com/). This shell is used to help rapidly deploy WordPress projects, while providing tools and patterns to solve immediate, complex needs.


This framework is based on the fine folks contributing to [HTML5 Blank](http://html5blank.com), with heavy modifications by [Cam Hayes](http://cerherm.com).
